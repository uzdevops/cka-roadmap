"""a per-track allowlist, on top of the two category grants

0007 split access into two category checkboxes - topics and certificates -
which answers "which KIND of student is this" but not "this person bought CKA
and nothing else". The new column is that finer grain: an explicit allowlist
of track slugs, or NULL.

NULL is the important value. It means "the categories decide", which is the
entire existing behaviour, and it is what every existing row gets - so nobody's
access changes when this lands. A list means exactly those tracks, categories
ignored; an empty list means no tracks at all.

JSONB rather than an association table: the list is tiny, is read on every
content request, and is never queried from the track side.
